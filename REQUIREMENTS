#
# this is pistol's requirement file
# this file is managed by bucket (bkt), which makes it easier to update dependencies
#
# how it works:
# - run this file in a terminal using 
# - 1. source path/to/REQUIREMENTS on linux/ubuntu
# - 2. path/to/REQUIREMENTS on windows
# - bucket (bkt) has to be installed for this to work. install it using pipx install bkt
# - run bucket dep install --name * to install all dependencies
#
# note: lines starting with # are ignored
# note: this file is not compatible with pip (pip install -r path/to/REQUIREMENTS will NOT work)
# for contributors: this file should not be modified
# for contributors: to add a dependency, run bucket dep add <arguments>
#
